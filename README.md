# stepwise-problem

Working through the problem described in Program development by stepwise refinement [Link](http://plbpc001.ouhk.edu.hk/~mt311/optional-reading/stepwise.pdf)

## Problem Statement:-
Given an 8x8 chessboard and 8 queens which are hostile to each other. Find a position for each queen
(a configuration) such that no queen may be taken by any other queen (i.e. such that every row, column
and diagonal contains at most one queen).

My initial attempt before reading the paper is in before.clj, and the one after reading the paper in after.clj
